It solely depends on .NET Core SDK which includes all the necessary packages to build and run the console application."},{"role":"user","content":"Unit tests:\n\nGiven the simplicity of this requirement, writing a test for console output might be overkill and could complicate the setup unnecessarily. However, if you insist on doing so, there are techniques to capture console output for assertion in the tests.\n\nHere we go:\n\nFile: Program.cs\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        public static void PrintMessage()\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n        }\n\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            PrintMessage();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, to test this application we're going to be capturing the console output and checking it against our expected output. \n\nFile: ProgramTests.cs\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing HelloWorld;\nusing Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;\n\nnamespace HelloWorldTest\n{\n    [TestClass]\n    public class ProgramTests\n    {\n        private StringWriter stringWriter;\n        private StringReader stringReader;\n\n        [TestInitialize]\n        public void SetUp()\n        {\n            stringWriter = new StringWriter();\n            Console.SetOut(stringWriter);\n\n            stringReader = new StringReader(stringWriter.ToString());\n            Console.SetIn(stringReader);\n        }\n\n        [TestCleanup]\n        public void TearDown()\n        {\n            stringWriter.Close();\n            stringReader.Close();\n        }\n\n        [TestMethod]\n        public void TestPrintMessage()\n        {\n            Program.PrintMessage();\n            string expected = string.Format(\"Hello, World!{0}\", Environment.NewLine);\n            Assert.AreEqual(expected, stringWriter.ToString());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis is the most optimal way to assert console output in the test. This test verifies that the method `PrintMessage` indeed writes \"Hello, World!\" to standard output. \n\nNote: For running these tests you will need to add references to `Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting` in your test project via NuGet package manager. Make sure to setup your project accordingly."},{"role":"user","content":"Please now remember the steps:\n\nThink step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.\nFirst lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.\n\nThen you will output the content of each file including ALL code.\nEach file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that\n[FILENAME] is the lowercase file name including the file extension,\n[LANG] is the markup code block language for the code's language, and [CODE] is the code:\n\nSyntax:\n[FILENAME]\n```[LANG]\n[CODE]\n```\n\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional.

It's a single file with a static Main method that serves as the entry point of the application. When run, the application prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n\nThis demonstrates the basic structure and execution of a C# program, and requires no additional imports, classes, or methods. The code is fully functional as it stands and should work in any .NET Framework or .NET Core environment. \n\nTo run this application, you can write or copy this code into a file named \"Program.cs\", compile it using the C# compiler (csc.exe) included with .NET Framework or .NET Core SDK, and then execute the resulting executable file.\n\nThe file can be compiled from the command line as follows:\n\n```shell\ncsc Program.cs\n```\n\nAnd the program can be run like this:\n\n```shell\nProgram\n```\n\nYou'll then see \"Hello, World!\" output in your console.
